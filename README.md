# Magic the Gathering
W.I.P. version 0.1
# Create Magic Card Library
Run card_library.py first to create .db file. This will take a while since there are over 20,000 cards to grab from Scryfall.com
It will save all the card images in the magic_cards/images folder under database.
Once it has created the library you must create a deck to save

# Create a deck 
There isn't too much of a limit when it comes to making your deck. Run the deck_build.py file and it will ask what card is your commander. Remember how you type this name as it will be saved as that .db to user_decks for later use. DO NOT USE SPECIAL CHARACTERS :",'*&%$#@!~()./?[]{}
